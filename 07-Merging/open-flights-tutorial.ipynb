    "2. A file with one record for each airline, \n",
    "3. A file with one record for each each route, \n",

    "5. A file with one record for each country.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each file has a relationship to the others, with some fields in common.  To make best use of the data, we will need to combine all three files.  This is the core challenge of relational databases.  This lesson looks at how to do that, specifically using the merge() function in python.  \n",

    "1. Understand the meaning of relational data and be able to identify common keys. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Understand the different types of relational joins: concatenate, inner join, outer join, left join, right join. \n",
